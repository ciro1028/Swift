## I can't see my AirTurn in the list?

* Make sure Bluetooth is turned on
* Make sure the AirTurn is on and the Bluetooth indicator is flashing twice a second
* Make sure the AirTurn is in range (10m)
* Make sure the AirTurn is on mode 1: press the mode button once and wait for the confirmation flash on the battery indicator
* If the AirTurn still doesn't appear, try resetting it.  To do this, while the device is on hold the power button for 6 seconds (the device will power off, keep holding) until both indicators flash 3 times and the device resets

## I can see my AirTurn in the list, but it won't connect?

* Try resetting the AirTurn (see the last step in the previous question)
* Check that there isn't another device in range that is automatically re-connecting to the AirTurn.  Only one computer/tablet can be connected to an AirTurn at once
* If you have paired to the AirTurn previously go to iOS Settings > Bluetooth, find the AirTurn in the list, tap the (i) icon, tap "Forget this device"
* Turn Bluetooth off and on again
* If your iOS version is lower than 7.1 (find out in iOS Settings > General > About > Version) we recommend you upgrade to iOS 7.1 as there are known bugs in iOS.  If this is not possible, try restarting the iPad or resetting network settings

## I tried the steps listed, it still doesn't work?

* Try removing the battery and re-inserting it to restart the AirTurn
